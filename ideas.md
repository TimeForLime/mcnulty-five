MIMIC (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) database - huge patient data set
https://mimic.physionet.org/about/mimic/

### On MIMIC data and what we discussed w Brian/Andrew. 
 - Current (?) models of IUC death prediction (2014) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24643928
 - Platelets as predictors (2014) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24895093  
 - Prediction of evolution towards brain death (2013) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23517301
 - On predictors and causes of death (2010) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20386386  

### Similar ICU study from UCSF
- http://healthpolicy.ucsf.edu/content/icu-outcomes
- Seemingly some sort of regression, they explored variables interactions.

### On brainstorm product ideas
- Find an unexplored / cheaper option for morbidity predictors in IUC.  i.e. Like the platelets study
- A better outcome for organ donation (maybe we could concentrate in younger patients?)
