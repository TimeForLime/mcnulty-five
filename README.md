## Problem Statement
We are working on building a classification model to predict mortality risk of ICU patients based on variables related to their care during their hospital stay. For this, we will use the MIMIC III ICU database as our primary resource, which contains all recorded anonymized information pertaining to patient admissions (Approximately 40,000 total patients) at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston from 2001-2012.
